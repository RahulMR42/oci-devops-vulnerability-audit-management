A sample illustration of Code Vulnerabilities for Maven packages 
------

The Application Dependency Management (ADM) service provides you with an integrated vulnerability knowledge base that you can use from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) DevOps build pipelines to detect vulnerabilities in the packages used for the build.


Objective
---

- Create an OCI build pipeline with a sample java - maven based application .
- Instantiate a vulernability scan and demonstrate sucess and failure conditions .

Procedure to use the illustration
-------
- Create an OCI notification topic - https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Notification/Tasks/managingtopicsandsubscriptions.htm#createTopic
- Create a devops project - https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/devops/using/create_project.htm#create_a_project.
- Associate with the notification topic.

- Create an OCI Dynamic group and add below rules . - https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingdynamicgroups.htm 

```markdown
ALL {resource.type = 'devopsbuildpipeline', resource.compartment.id = 'COMPARMENT_OCID'}

ALL {resource.type = 'devopsrepository', resource.compartment.id = 'COMPARMENT_OCID'}
```

- Create an OCI policy and add below policies - https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policies.htm
